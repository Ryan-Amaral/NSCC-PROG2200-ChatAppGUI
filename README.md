<p>A project for an Advanced OOP class at NSCC. This program is a GUI based chat application that communicates over TCP/IP with a <a href="https://github.com/Ryan-Amaral/NSCC-PROG2200-ChatAppConsole">server</a>. This version of chat app is asynchronous, so can receive messages even while typing its own.</p><br/>
<p>To chat with this program the server must be started. To do this, the other <a href="https://github.com/Ryan-Amaral/NSCC-PROG2200-ChatAppConsole">console based program</a> must be started with the option '-server'. Once the server is started, the gui program has an option in the top toolbar to connect to the server on the default port. Once a connection is made, the user is notified and can start sending and receiving messages.</p><br/>
